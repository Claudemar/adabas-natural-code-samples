Here's a sample program to use the Source Work Area as you would a temporary WORK file.

Use DEFINE PRINTER to write records to the Source Work Area.

Use USR2014N to retrieve a record at a time, as you would with a READ WORK.

**The code has been updated to allow for a record length of 133, as for a standard report.**

Tested under 6.2.2 and 4.1.4.
