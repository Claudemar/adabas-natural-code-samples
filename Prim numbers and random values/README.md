The enclosed samples calculate prim numbers and provide functions for random values.

**Function DICE**

See [program1](program1.txt)
Returns random number from 1 to #P_MAX (input parm).


**Function RAND**

See [program2](program2.txt)
Returns random (F8) number 0 <= RAND < 1
It uses the time stamp and the biggest (I4) prim number for the calculation.


**Program DEAL1**

See [program3](program3.txt)
Mixes the numbers from 1 to 20 by calling the subprogram DEAL.


**Program DICE06**

See [program4](program4.txt)
Call the function DICE(<6>) to throw a standard dice (1 to 6) and count the occurrences.


**Program PRIM**

See [program5](program5.txt)
Calculate prim numbers until a given max value (I4).


**Subprogram DEAL**

See [program6](program6.txt)
Mix numbers randomly like dealing cards.
