* Example 1: Shows how to calculate EOM of the current or prior month.
* Example 2: Adds 28 instead of 31 to avoid that a date of 1/29/06 results in an EOM value of 2/28/06.


**Example 1:** 
If you omit the ADD 31 TO #DATE you will get the EOM of the prior month, else you will get the EOM of the current month. Thus you are enabled to go to any EOM in the past or the future.
 
**Example 2:**
This works regardless of the number of days in the following month.
